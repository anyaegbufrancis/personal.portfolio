#  CSS and Bootstrap Homework: Responsive Portfolio

This task is aimed at designing a responsive website across 3 major screen sizes.

It involves a multi page web pages linked together with all links active.

Some of the tasks are completed but some are still pending. However, work on this site will continue even after the appraisal. My target is to get preliminary feedback, learn from the process and continue improving.


## Approach Adopted

A lot of effort was put into designing a functional 'index.html' page. It is an exciting learning experience but also a chance to doublecheck my understanding of the contents Some of the completed and remaining tasks that make up this project include :

* Creating the following files files: `index.html`, `portfolio.html` and `contact.html`.

* Using Bootstrap, develop your portfolio site with the following items:

   * A navbar

   * A responsive layout

   * Responsive images



### Other Requirements

This is a work in progress but the key measurement indicators after successful implementation include:

* Functional, deployed application

* GitHub repository with updated README describing the project

* Navbar must be consistent on each page.

* Navbar on each page must contain links to Home/About, Contact, and Portfolio pages.

* All links must work.

* Must use semantic html.

* Each page must have valid and correct HTML. (use a validation service)

* Must contain your personalized information. (bio, name, images, links to social media, etc.)

* Must properly utilize Bootstrap components and grid system.
