                            <p class="body-text">Thank you for visiting my profile page. I am an Infrastructure Engineer (Networking,
                                compute, virtualization & cloud) with more than 10 years experience in the industry verticals. I started off my 
                            career as a network Engineer and grew to the peak of my networking career as an expert level SME in Data Cengter, Service Provider,
                            Enterprise Networking & Security. I presently work as a converged/hyper-converged network expert with deep expertise ranging from 
                            Data Center networking, cloud, DevOps, service provider networking, solution design & consulting, Project Management, Enterprise Architecture,
                            and services management.</p> <p class="body-text"> I have earned some of the key industry class certifications including 3 x CCIE (Data Center, Enterprise & Service Provider)
                            , PMP, TOGAF 9, VMware VCAP- Network Virtualization, AWS Solutions Architect Professional, Dell CI/HCI Specialist among others.  My interest shifted recently to the application layer and  I found no better way to understand it than to engage in a coding BootCamp 
                            offered in Georgia Institutue of Technology  Coding BootCamp. My plan is to get deeper into the DevOps space and gain a better understanding of the 
                            developer's attitude, mindset and execution strategy to enable me engage better with cross-functional teams I come in contact with daily.

                            <p class="body-text">I am not sure I see myself building a career in application development (though it is a
                                lot of fun doing those) but more as a network/ virtualization/ cloud engineer solution provider trying to
                                understand the approach of software developers to problem solving. I want to solve the old problems using better tools. I also want to position myself betterto lead
                                cross-functional teams to deliver quality solutions that have direct impact on end users and customers.</p>

                            <p class="body-text">Beyond my relationship with extremely smart machines, I am a proud husband, father and a 'culture enthusiast'...if there is anything
                                like that. It basically means that I am interested in learning from diverse people and the rich evolution of their cultural practises. For some strange reasons, I am just interested in that.</p>
                            <p class="body-text">What I like, well, I am an avid traveller and I am always facinated by classics. Music? Country. Yes!, I lean a bit
                                conservative on such when I select my playlist but when my mood does, I listen to everything. I like good wine the gentle breeze from the ocean...</p>
                            <p class="body-text">Sports? Swimming, tennis and open air running.</p>
                            <a class="body-text">To me, this is an adventure. I am learning a lot at this time and it is exciting. To see some of my works, please click
